This project contains module files and test for pseudo random number generators 
in Fortran 2008 objected oriented code. Eventually, we aim for threadsafe
behavior. The quality of the production generators is higher than that in e.g. 
gfortran, and can be explicitly decomposed for consistent multithread behavior.
